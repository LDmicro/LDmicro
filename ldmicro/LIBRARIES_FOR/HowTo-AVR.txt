
    LdMicro for AVR ATMega microcontrollers
    _________________________________________


    LdMicro 5 offers new functions like SPI or I2C via C programming

    If everything is well configured, one can generate C files,
    hex file, and upload it to the target without exiting LdMicro



How to test LdMicro on AVRs (AtMega) with ADC, PWM, SPI or I2C functions:
______________________________________________________________________

1)  Install AvrStudio 5, 6 or 7 (7 not tested) from Atmel site
    or install directly an avr-gcc for windows from
    https://www.microchip.com/mplab/avr-support/avr-and-arm-toolchains-c-compilers

2)  Copy LdMicro executable and flashMCU.bat in a same directory.
    Also copy LIBRARIES_FOR directory and its content at the same place.

3)  Edit FlashMCU.bat (right click + Modify) and in section AVRGCC,
    modify GCCPATH to point to your avr-gcc path instead of mine

    If you intend to use AvrDude to flash the target, modify the path
    DUDPATH too, and adapt avrdude.exe command line according to your
    AVR programmer

    It'll be possible anyway to generate hex file with script and
    flash the target with it manually next.

4)  Create a ladder with LdMicro in a directory.

5)  Compile the ladder with "Compile ATMEL AVR-GCC" (not the same now
    as Win-AVR) and generate the C file in the same directory as the
    source (.ld) file, with the same name (.c)

    It also generates a (.h) file and a ladder.h header
    With joined libraries, it makes a ready-made C project

6)  Launch FlashMCU.bat from LdMicro to get the hex file and upload
    it to the target automatically or manually from "bin" subdirectory

    Look at the command window ; there shouln't be compiling errors
    Librairies are automaticaly copied (first time only) in "lib"
    subdirectory where they can be adapted if need be
    Intermediate files are generated in "obj" subdirectory

7)  Test generated hex file on target...


    Of course it needs to be tested furthermore...
    Please report problems (and successes) on ldmicro forum



NB: The libraries have been tested on AtMega8, 16 and 328
    It's possible (and easy) to adapt the code to other targets of the
    same family by using compiling directives.
    The name of the target is defined in ladder.h as LDTARGET_atmegaxxx

    You can use several ADCs or PWMs, but only one Uart, one SPI and one I2C
    (But with several peripherals with different software SS pins on SPI
    or with diferent addresses on I2C Bus)

NB: SPI must be named "SPI" on AVRs
    SPI new functions are:
    SPI Send/Receive, which sends and/or receives a byte
    SPI Write, which send an alphanumerical string to SPI without reception

    SPI frequency is defined as UART's one in the global settings
    SPI works only in master mode with most standard config

NB: I2C must be called "I2C" on AVRs
    I2C new functions are:
    I2C Read to read one byte in a peripheral's register
    I2C Write to write a byte to a peripheral's register

    I2C frequency is also defined in global settings
    I2C also works only in master mode

NB: All the frequencies used by ADC, PWM or SPI are obtained from CPU clock
    by a dividing factor. There are few choices for this factor, so frequencies
    are very approximative. To have hints about frequencies compile in Hex/Asm
    and look at given information or compute it by looking at libraries
    or datasheet
    I2C frequency is more precise because of configuration possibilities

NB: ADC max available resolution is used
    PWM max resolution is used and parameter is only % between 0 and 100
