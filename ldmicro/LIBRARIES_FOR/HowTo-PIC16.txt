
	LdMicro for PIC16F microcontrollers
	_________________________________________


	LdMicro 5 offers new functions like SPI or I2C via C programming

	If everything is well configured, one can generate C files,
	hex file, and upload it to the target without exiting LdMicro



How to test LdMicro on PICs (16F) with ADC, PWM, SPI or I2C functions:
______________________________________________________________________

1)	Install Hi-Tech C alias PicC compiler for PIC16
	
2)	Copy LdMicro executable and flashMCU.bat in a same directory.
	Also copy LIBRARIES_FOR directory and its content at the same place.

3)	Edit FlashMCU.bat (right click + Modify) and in section HTC,
	modify PCCPATH to point to your picc path instead of mine

	If you intend to use a command line tool to flash the target, 
	fill in the Transfer section with proper commands.

	It'll be possible anyway to generate hex file with script and
	flash the target with it manually next

4)	Create a ladder with LdMicro in a directory.

5)	Compile the ladder with "Compile HI-TECH C for PIC" and generate 
	the C file in the same directory as the source (.ld) file, 
	with the same name (.c)
	
	It also generates a (.h) file and a ladder.h header
	With joined libraries, it makes a ready-made C project

6)	Launch FlashMCU.bat from LdMicro to get the hex file and upload 
	it to the target automatically or manually from "bin" subdirectory

	Look at the command window ; there shouln't be compiling errors
	Librairies are automaticaly copied (first time only) in "lib" 
	subdirectory where they can be adapted if need be
	Intermediate files are generated in "obj" subdirectory

7)	Test generated hex file on target...


	Of course it needs to be tested furthermore...
	Please report problems (and successes) on ldmicro forum



NB:	The libraries have been tested on PIC16F876 in simulation, but should
	work for all PIC16F declared in LdMicro.
	It's possible (and easy) to adapt the code to other targets of the 
	same family by using compiling directives.
	The name of the target is defined in ladder.h as LDTARGET_pic16fxxx

	You can use several ADCs or PWMs, but only one Uart, one SPI and one I2C
	(But with several peripherals with different software SS pins on SPI
	or with diferent addresses on I2C Bus)

NB:	SPI must be named "SPI" on PICs
	SPI new functions are:
	SPI Send/Receive, which sends and/or receives a byte 
	SPI Write, which send an alphanumerical string to SPI without reception

	SPI frequency is defined as UART's one in the global settings
	SPI works only in master mode with most standard config

NB:	I2C must be called "I2C" on PICs
	I2C new functions are:
	I2C Read to read one byte in a peripheral's register
	I2C Write to write a byte to a peripheral's register

	I2C frequency is also defined in global settings
	I2C also works only in master mode

NB:	All the frequencies used by ADC, PWM, SPI or I2Care obtained from CPU clock
	by a dividing factor. There are few choices for this factor, so frequencies
	are very approximative. 

NB:	ADC max available resolution is used
	PWM max resolution is used and parameter is only % between 0 and 100
